    <td>We had learnt to code a google sheets to make sure we could encrypt the code but now be had to do the reverse and decrypt a code. The code we used last week was vlookup(E3, $A, $B, 2, false) and this week we learn that if we filled the whole line with code but then if we didn't put a word in a column the it would return #N/A which is ugly so we used the code iferror(vlookup(E3, $A, $B, 2, false),) then it would return back nothing which if this was an app would look alot more reliable. But to decrypt it I need to use the code in reverse iferror(vlookup(E5, $C, $D, 2, false),) still using the iferror so it looks nicer.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was quite hard because I think everyone just tried to swamp the $A and $B so it would look at a different column but then we realised it just switched it back to the original so I had to make two more columns so it was $C $D. Also the dollar sign means it carries on the same code rather than transfer it along a column every time you used it. I think I could be a bit more persevering in my learning rather than turning to someone else when I get it wrong. I think I should be a bit more logical in my learning.</td>
