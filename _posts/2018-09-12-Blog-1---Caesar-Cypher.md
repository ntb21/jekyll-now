    <td>The Caesar cipher is a code that means the actual letters correspond or are a certain number of letters forward or backwards in the alphabet. For example if I took the word hello and made it the cipher of +3 then the word i would send would be ebiil and the word world would be tloia. Therefore the message I would send would be ebiil tloia and I have to say that that seems a very weird massage to send especially if you not meant to be reading it!!!</td>

    <td>I think I was rather confused at the start because I didn't really know what to think of the topic we were about to study, and I found it quite overwhelming at the start when Mr Tansley said we were going to code in google sheets I was really confused. Then I realised sheets was a lot more complicated with all the functions and formulae. Overall I got in to it by the end and I thought I was learning really well.  </td>
